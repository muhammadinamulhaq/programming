            As I gaze out my rear bedroom window I neglect to see the scenery all around my brown and beige swimming pool. I typically just think to myself, " ah nothing different just the pool in the backyard." When the seasons change I don't observe the pool's altering environment. I think I'll now finally stop and admire some of the beauty and surroundings of my pool during the different seasons.
             While I sit here and stare out my back window, I notice the immaculately tall trees shading the dock and pool. The trees seem as if they are endless. It is almost like they reach the clouds. Soon the leaves will change to beautiful shades of orange and red. Eventually they will fall and cover everything below it. The trees are also homes to many birds. In the early hours of the morning you can hear all of the crows cawing, and the cardinals chirping. When the weather gets cold I know personally I will not miss being woken up early by the sounds of the many birds.
             Now even though the pool is closed for the winter, I know in my head the water is still crystal clear. For me I can see the bottom liner of the pool with the water, but there is actually a dark hunter green pool cover on top. The cover is held up by a big inflatable pillow, which floats in the middle of the water. All around the outside cover lays stagnant water. The water now holds as a good breeding ground for mosquitoes, or provides as a good drinking hole for my cat.
             As for the plants and grass surrounding the pool, it is still green and living. Even though, the weather has been extremely dry lately the grass still puts up a fight to keep from turning hard, crunchy, and brown. The plants adjacent to the pool have lost most of the frail white flower, but still have their six-inch long leaves. Soon the grass will turn brown and the leaves from the plants will fall, making the setting around the pool seem lifeless.
